Idea: Create a pretend lead/marketing agency home/landing page that is responsive.

Choice of Framework: Bootstrap has become one of my favorite front-end frameworks due to its speed and simplicity of using CSS and JS. It also helps create a foundation in terms of layout design.

First step was to create navigation bar. I wanted it to be responsive so I utilized the class callings for size and the ability to toggle it. I used collapse, navbar-toggler, and set the navbar as the target.

I then wanted to create a showcase with a background and an attention grabbing headline. This space can be utilized for many things though such as a call to action or a into retrieve point like an email address. Instead I went with an interactive button that goes directly to services

Then I created my about section using the accordion feature with Bootstrap. This was done by creating a card and a toggle call to collapse and expand the content. One card was expanded and set to show automatically no matter what and then requiring an on click action for the other two cards utilizing JS. This would create some engagement with the user to learn more information.

Next I wanted to show off who the leaders are by creating cards for each column. For any agency, or any product, it's important to create trust and this is one of those ways.I then created a profile which would have a quick bio of each person. Then I utilized an overlay in the style sheet so every time a user would hover over each card, to create some more engagement which would then also show the social media icons/links for each profile.

Then the services, which would be kept simple and to point by creating a container with three columns and utilized some color features in the classes such as muted and dark and a colored border and an infill to create contrast amount the columns.

Then it would be the contact part, which was done by creating a container, then a row, then a column and then a form all nested within each other. I created a class group and utilized font awesome icons. Used a couple classes for a large submit button and also make it responsive.

Last but not least, created a simple footer that was also responsive.
